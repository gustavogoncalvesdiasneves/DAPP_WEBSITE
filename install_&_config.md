# Decentralized Website Installation Guide

This guide provides instructions for setting up and accessing a decentralized website using IPFS (InterPlanetary File System).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) (Kubo)
- A text editor (e.g., VSCode)
- Terminal/Command Prompt

## Steps to Set Up the Decentralized Website

### 1. Install IPFS

If you haven't installed IPFS yet, follow the instructions on the [IPFS installation page](https://docs.ipfs.io/install/).

### 2. Initialize IPFS

After installing IPFS, initialize it by running:

```sh
ipfs init
```

### 3. Start the IPFS Daemon

Start the IPFS daemon to enable communication with the IPFS network:

```sh
ipfs daemon
```

### 4. Add Your Website Files to IPFS

Navigate to the directory containing your website files and add them to IPFS:

```sh
ipfs add -r /path/to/your/website
```

Replace `/path/to/your/website` with the actual path to your website directory. This command will return a hash (CID) that you can use to access your files.

### 5. Access Your Website

You can access your website using any public IPFS gateway. Replace `QmHashYourWebsite` with the hash (CID) returned in the previous step:

```sh
https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmHashYourWebsite
```

Alternatively, you can use other gateways like:

- [Cloudflare IPFS Gateway](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmHashYourWebsite)
- [Infura IPFS Gateway](https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmHashYourWebsite)

### 6. Improve Accessibility and Performance (Optional)

To enhance the accessibility and performance of your website, consider the following:

#### Use a Pinning Service

Services like Pinata and Infura can pin your content, ensuring it remains available and is served more quickly.

- **Pinata**: [pinata.cloud](https://pinata.cloud)
- **Infura**: [infura.io](https://infura.io)

#### Deploy on a Decentralized Hosting Platform

Platforms like Fleek and Spheron provide easy-to-use solutions for deploying decentralized websites.

- **Fleek**: [fleek.co](https://fleek.co)
- **Spheron**: [spheron.network](https://spheron.network)

### Example: Using Pinata for Pinning

1. **Create an Account on Pinata**

   Register at [pinata.cloud](https://pinata.cloud) and log in.

2. **Pin Your Files**

   Use Pinata's web interface to upload and pin your website files or use their API for programmatic pinning.

### Example: Deploying on Fleek

1. **Create an Account on Fleek**

   Register at [fleek.co](https://fleek.co) and log in.

2. **Deploy Your Site**

   Connect your repository (e.g., GitHub) and follow Fleek's instructions to deploy your website.

## Troubleshooting

### IPFS Daemon Already Running

If you encounter an error indicating that the IPFS daemon is already running, stop the current daemon process:

```sh
killall ipfs
```

Then start the daemon again:

```sh
ipfs daemon
```

### Removing Lock Files

If you see an error about a lock file, remove it manually:

```sh
rm /home/your-username/.ipfs/repo.lock
```

Then start the daemon again:

```sh
ipfs daemon
```

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you should be able to set up and access your decentralized website using IPFS. For any further questions or assistance, feel free to reach out.

Happy decentralizing!
